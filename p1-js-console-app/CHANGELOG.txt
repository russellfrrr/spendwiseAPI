Passport Management System (CHANGES):

1.  Added a wrapper function for validating inputs (if it's a number or not).
    I guess i can't avoid using a double negative (!Number.isNaN) on validation
    but I put it inside of a function to make it more cleaner on my reused functions.

2.  Added a months object to avoid using magic numbers as much as possible.

3.  Fixed my indentions to two spaces on scopes.

4.  Changed all my do...while loops to while loops, and creating controlled infinite 
    loops (using loop control statements eg. continue, break, etc.) to make my logic
    more readable. I guess while loops (in this case) are more readable than the other
    one. 

5.  Fixed the whole logic of validating the date of birth. I first let the user input
    the year so I can take its value and add it in my leap year logic. My code will know 
    if the month inputted is 30 or 31 days, and if it's February, it computes if that 
    specific February is in a leap year or not, and it then queries the right range that
    the user will need to input (either 1-28 or 1-29).
